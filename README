This repo contains my learning of web-based Java programming.
I use Apache Tomcat with Netbean for these projects.

Most of these directly follow online tutorial.
The Hello Form is from: https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps.html
The Sign-in Form is from: https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps-struts.html
The WhiteBoardApp is from: https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/maven-websocketapi.html

The Projects project just serves to hold some personal front end work.
So far, all work here comes from FreeCodeCamp challeges.
